		<p align = "justify">. . .I hate the world, but I love the world.  I know everything and I know nothing.  
		I despise affection, yet I love affection.  These are my reasons for joining this site.
		I often crave affection, of my own want and need.  I am searching for someone who will allow me to both control them and make them inferior to me.  
		You may have to deal with my rants about how much I hate human existence, but you will learn to love me despite my differences. . .
		
		I am pleading with anyone who reads my profile to take into consideration my desperate need for love, because I need 
		<em>something different, quite different, for which I am thirsting, but which I cannot find!</em>
		<br />
		My philosophy is that <em>we can truly love only with suffering and through suffering! We know not how to love otherwise.</em>  Without suffering, there is no other feeling.  
		<em>We know no other love.  I want suffering in order to love.  I want and thirst this very minute to kiss, with tears streaming down my cheeks, 
		this one and only I have left behind. I don't want and won't accept any other.</em>
		
		Know that <em>I grew up without a home; and perhaps that's why I've turned so . . . unfeeling,</em> I implore you to help an intelligent and well-read man with the most
		prominent void within his life.
		<br />
		I hope you all can take into consideration the great service you will be doing both to yourself and myself by involving yourself with me.
		All in all, I believe that <em>with love one can live even without happiness,</em> for where there is love, there are never shadows too dark to overcome.</p>

<h2>2014 NJIT Web Design Competition</h2>
<p class="ptext">Each year, NJIT has a web design competition open to high schools who are willing to dedicate their time to create a website that is educational and incorporates technology of any sort.  Each school is allowed an unlimited number of teams with 3-4 students in each.  Each team creates an educational website and each member must create his or her own page with a topic pertaining to the theme of their website.  The Mount participated in this competition in 2012 and is now participating again for the 2014 competition.  <a href="http://is.njit.edu/events/webdesign/2014/" target="_blank">Click here</a> to learn more!</p>
